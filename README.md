# Roulette Data Collector
This is an FFXIV Dalamud plugin that collects data on duty roulettes that you participate in.

## Why data?
I wanted an easy way to get statistics on Mentor roulettes.

Also a project to get practice with databases.

## Where data?
I do not plan to move the data anywhere. It wil be stored in a local database where the person collecting can do whatever they want with it.

**Remember to always follow FFXIV rules, do not use data to harrass other players in game or out of game.**

## What data?
Data I will try to get, if possible.
- Queue duration
- Duty name
- Duty duration
- Resolution (cleared, vote-abandon, timed-out, etc)
- Number of wipes
- Party info
    - Name
    - Class
    - Item level (maybe exact gear)
- Maybe more at some point

~~I never realized how obviously french the word roulette is until I had to write it this much~~
